Gameplay:
1. Press "Space" to jump.
2. Use the left/ right arrow key or a/d to control the direction.
3. There are several traps such as spikes, saws, and hammers. Players have to jump over them and not touch them.
4. There are also some monsters such as slimes and ghosts. If a player touches them from the sides, the player will die. But if the player jumps right on the top of them (just like Mario games), they will die. The monsters in the game have a health bar displayed above their heads, which indicates the amount of damage they can withstand. When the health bar is depleted, the monsters die.
5. Additionally, there are also different kinds of collectibles including gems and keys.Player has to collect them before you move forward to the exit door.
6. In level 3, a button can be found in the game that will grant you a skill book if activated once. The book will give you the power to shoot,(press letter J) which can be used to defeat the boss in the next level. Activating the button twice will cause a key to appear, which can be used to unlock the door leading to the boss level.
7. Towards the end of Level 3, there are challenging traps that require some exploration and trial-and-error. Keep trying and you'll eventually figure them out!
8. In the boss level, you'll encounter the main boss who can summon numerous little monsters. Defeat them individually, and keep an eye out for randomly dropped double-jump and speed-up skills to assist you in your battle. Once the boss is defeated, a door will appear that you can use to exit. As you progress through this level, keep an eye on your own health bar. If it runs out, you'll meet an unfortunate end. But don't worry, you can either try again by pressing the replay button or return to the home page.
9. For each level, a pause button will be displayed in the top-right corner, allowing you to pause the game at any time. Clicking on it will give you the option to either resume the game or return to the main menu.
10. Good Luck in game!!
